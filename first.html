<p> The use of cross-coupled vacuum tube amplifiers to produce a train of pulses was described by Eccles and Jordan in 1918. This circuit became the basis of the flip-flop, a circuit with two states that became the fundamental element of electronic binary digital computers.</p>

<p>The Atanasoffâ€“Berry computer, a prototype of which was first demonstrated in 1939, is now credited as the first vacuum tube computer.[1] However it was not a general-purpose computer being able to only solve a system of linear equations and it was also not very reliable.</p>


<p>The Colossus Computer at Bletchley Park During World War II, special purpose vacuum tube digital computers such as Colossus were used to break German and Japanese ciphers. The military intelligence gathered by these systems was essential to the Allied war effort. Each Colossus used between 1,600 and 2,400 vacuum tubes. [1] The existence of the machine was kept secret and the public was unaware of its application until the 1970s.[1]

Also during the war, electro-mechanical binary computers were being developed by Konrad Zuse. The German military establishment during the war did not prioritize computer development. An experimental electronic computer circuit with around 100 tubes was developed in 1942, but destroyed in an air raid.</p>

<p>In the United States, work started on the ENIAC computer late in the Second World War. The machine was completed in 1945. Although one application which motivated its development was the production of firing tables for artillery, one of the first uses of ENIAC was to carry out calculations related to the development of a hydrogen bomb. ENIAC was programmed with plugboards and switches instead of an electronically stored program. A post-war series of lectures disclosing the design of ENIAC, and a report by John von Neumann on a foreseeable successor to ENIAC, First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, were widely distributed and were influential in the design of post-war vacuum tube computers.</p>

<p>The Ferranti Mark 1 (1951) is considered the first commercial vacuum tube computer. The first mass-produced computer was the IBM 650 (1953).
