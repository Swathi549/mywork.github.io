<h1> the first generation computers</h1>
<p>The period 1940 to 1956, roughly considered as the First Generation of Computer.</p>
<p>The first generation computers were developed by using vacuum tube or thermionic valve machine.</p>
<p>The input of this system was based on punched cards and paper tape; however, the output was displayed on printout.</p>
<p>The first generation computers worked on binary-coded concept (i.e., language of 0-1). Examples: ENIAC, EDVAC, etc.

<h1> the second generation computers</h1>
<p>The period 1956 to 1963 is roughly considered as the period of Second Generation of Computers.</p>
<p> The second generation computers were developed by using transistor technology.</p>
<p> In comparison to the first generation, the size of second generation was smaller.</p>
<p> In comparison to computers of the first generation, the computing time taken by the computers of the second generation was lesser.</p>
